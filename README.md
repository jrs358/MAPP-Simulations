# MAPP-Simulations
Simulations performed using the Berkeley Model and Algorithm Prototyping Platform (MAPP) in support of my dissertation.

This repository contains code which is derived from the MAPP (Berkeley Model and Algorithm Prototyping Platform) software (https://github.com/jaijeet/MAPP) and the associated paper 'Well-Posed Models of Memristive Devices', by Tianshi Wang and Jaijeet Roychowdhury (2016). It is released under the same terms as MAPP; the GNU General Public License (GPL) V3. Please read the license file for details.

The MAPP Developers remain the authors and owners of this code. Any modifications made are for entirely academic purposes.
